# Machine Learning Projects

I wanted to learn machine learning so I decided to learn by doing. 
Currently adding new models from scratch as I learn about them. 
I've implemented KNN, KMeans, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes 
Models.


## Lessons Learned

I've learned that machine learning is mostly formatting and standardizing the data and optimizing models rather than building the models. Also, I'd probably never build my own model from 
scratch in the future as I can easily import a library with it.

I've been able to fully understand the workings of several machine learning
models and I am continuing to further my understanding of machine learning.
